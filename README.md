# PowerMage2k18
2d + 3d canvas game about a mage who's strong (completion: 2d 10%, 3d 5%)

PROJECT PROGRESS: https://trello.com/b/cVi9Nqy5/3d-2d-powermage-2k18

PROJECT IDEAS: 

3d:
1. Choose between compiled scalers (JDC tech) and full affine texture transformation in mini-buffer (current state)
2. Full ray casting implementation based on tiles-map-array (currently only one 90deg ray casts)

2d:
1. use 2d render as a radar-map

Some 2d screenshots (dynamic resolution system can extends upto whole map space)
